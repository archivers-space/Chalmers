Service for managing & executing archiving tasks. All task definitions are in the `taskdefs`, directory. task_mgmt manages the state of tasks as they move through the queue, questions like "what tasks are currently running?". As tasks are completed task_mgmt updates records of when tasks started, finished, or failed.

## Usage

If you have docker & [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), clone this repo & run the following:
```shell
# first, cd into the project directory, then run
docker-compose up

# this should respond with json, having an empty "data" array
http://localhost:8080/tasks

# this should respond with json, with meta.message : "task successfully enqueud"
http://localhost:8080/ipfs/add?url=https://i.redd.it/5kwih5n5i58z.jpg

# requesting this again should now show a taskÂ in the data array, including a "succeeded" timestamp:
http://localhost:8080/tasks

# congrats, you've put this url of a jpeg on ipfs: https://i.redd.it/5kwih5n5i58z.jpg
# view it here:
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeDchVWNVxFcEvnbtBbio88UwrHSCqEAXpcj2gX3aufvv

# connect to your ipfs server here:
# click the "files" tab, and you'll see this hash: QmeDchVWNVxFcEvnbtBbio88UwrHSCqEAXpcj2gX3aufvv
# this means you have a local ipfs node serving the image we just processed
https://localhost:5001/webui
```
